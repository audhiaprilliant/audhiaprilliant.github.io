<p>For this project, we use primary data of Twitter by crawling on 28th - 29th of May 2019. Further, the data is in csv format (comma delimited). It refers into two topics, the data of Joko Widodo which contains the keyword “Joko Widodo” and the other one is the data of Prabowo Subianto that has the keyword “Prabowo Subianto”. These include several variables and information in order to determine user sentiment. Actually, the data has 16 variables or attributes and more than 1000 observations (for both data).
