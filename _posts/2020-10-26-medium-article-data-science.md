### Overview
Medium is a well-regarded platform for publishing and sharing articles globally. As a data science enthusiast, I began writing articles on Medium two months ago and have since connected with many individuals who share similar interests. I have found this experience to be quite enriching and enjoyable, and as such, I plan to continue sharing my insights and projects on the platform in addition to this blog. If you are also interested in following my work on Medium, I would be delighted to connect with you there as well.

Medium is a highly reputable platform that provides an avenue for writers to share their ideas, experiences, and knowledge with a wider audience. Over the past two months, I have been utilizing this platform to write articles related to various aspects of data science. My articles have covered a wide range of categories, including Explanatory Data Analysis and Data Visualization, Statistical Theory and Simulation, Statistical Analysis, Supervised Learning (Classification and Regression), Unsupervised Learning (Clustering), Data Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Financial Analysis, Image Analysis, Open-sources, and Graph Theory. Through these articles, I have been able to connect with many like-minded individuals who share a passion for data science, and I am grateful for the opportunities that this platform has provided. Moving forward, I plan to continue sharing my experiences and projects on Medium, and I invite anyone who is interested to connect with me there as well.
