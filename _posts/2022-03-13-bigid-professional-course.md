### Course Overview
Designed for BigID customers and partners who seek a multi-disciplinary understanding of BigID in a condensed format, this course combines bizuser, operator and admin topics into a single session and is intended for anyone tasked with multiple cross-domain platform responsibilities. Through theory and practice, learners are introduced to BigID's value and core discovery, the user interface and main use cases, data scanning and analysis, strategy for platform deployment, and general administration and maintenance.

This 2-day course offers the same exact content and enables the same exact certifications like the BigID Associate BizUser, BigID Associate Operator and BigID Associate Admin half-day courses combined.
