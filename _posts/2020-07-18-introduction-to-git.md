### Overview
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel. On a very basic level, there are two awesome things a VCS allows you to do: You can track changes in your files and it simplifies working on files and projects with multiple people.
