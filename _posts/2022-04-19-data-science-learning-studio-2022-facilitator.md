Data Science Learning Studio (DSLS) 2022 is a program created by the Indonesian Data Science Community which is a data science learning space for fresh graduates and professionals in scaling up their hard skills for professional work. In 2022, DSLS brings the main theme **"Data Literacy for Better Policy"** with the hope that fresh graduates and professionals in the public sector (Government agencies or NGOs) can implement data science in various problems in the public sector in Indonesia.

After participants joined a class, they can utilize the Stackoverflow as a space for discussion, about data science materials, daily homework, experiences in professional work, etc. And as a facilitator, I must ensure the participants get the right answers and solutions, from technical to theoretical overviews. Honestly, it was my first time using Stackoverflow as a space for discussion because mostly it's just a space for looking for a solution to my coding problems.
