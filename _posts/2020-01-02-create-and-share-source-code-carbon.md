### Overview
As Data Scientist, we usually work with programming language such as R or Python to manipulate data, build classification model, build interactive data visualization, or something else. It's good to keep our source codes in distributed version control system like Git. But can we create beautiful format of our source codes? So we can efficiently share our source codes to community or other people in social media, such as Twitter. The answer is yes, we can create and share our beautiful source codes using [**carbon**](https://carbon.now.sh/).
