### Overview
As a Data Scientist, it is common to work with programming languages such as R or Python for data manipulation, building classification models, creating interactive data visualization, and more. It is important to keep our source codes in a distributed version control system like Git, but what if we want to share our code in a more aesthetically pleasing format? This is where tools like [**carbon**](https://carbon.now.sh/) come in. With carbon, we can create and share beautifully formatted source code on social media platforms such as Twitter or with the wider community.
