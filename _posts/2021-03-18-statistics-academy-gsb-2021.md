### Overview
In 2021, the students association of Gamma Sigma Beta, Department of Statistics organized an event called Statistics Academy, aimed to enhance their members' skills and knowledge. Statistics Academy is an annual event, which usually has a main theme related to the application of Statistics in the professional world, survey and sampling in politics, trends of data science, machine learning, etc. For the series of Statistics Academy 2021, Gamma Sigma Beta chose Market Research as the main theme.

As a moderator, I was responsible for managing the discussion between the speaker, Rahmanu Ganesya, and the participants regarding the sentiment analysis in market research. This event attracted a lot of enthusiasm among the participants as they had the opportunity to develop a machine learning model for sentiment analysis and compete for the secret awards based on the model's accuracy. The discussion focused on various topics such as the importance of sentiment analysis in market research, the methodology of building a sentiment analysis model, the use of relevant data, and how to interpret the results obtained from the model. The event helped the participants to gain practical knowledge and experience in the field of market research and machine learning.
