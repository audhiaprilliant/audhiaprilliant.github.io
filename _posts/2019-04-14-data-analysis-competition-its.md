As a member of Pekan Analisis Statistika, I collaborated with Aynayatul Khoiriyah for the Data Analysis Competition (DAC) held in 2019. Since it was an international event in the Southeast Asian region, English was the official language used. The competition consisted of three stages: preliminary, semifinal, and final. In the preliminary round, we were provided with the Air Quality Index (AQI) data of the United States. Before proceeding with the data analysis and exploration, we conducted thorough data pre-processing to ensure the data's integrity.

The primary objectives of our analysis were to identify several clusters in the US based on AQI data and to explore the characteristics of AQI and pollutants in each state of the US.

In the semifinal stage of the competition, which included 30 top teams, 27 of which were national and the rest international, our team had to develop an exploration and classification model for telecommunication data within a four-hour time frame. Despite having only one laptop for both writing the paper and conducting the modeling, we were able to create a simple classification model for churn prediction using the Decision Tree algorithm with a sampling method. The experience was truly exhilarating and challenging. Several objectives from semifinal stage as follow:
- To explore variables in the data to obtain information and knowledge about customer behaviour in telecommunication company
- To classify and determine the rule either customer is churn or not using Decision Tree algorithm
- To find out the important variables that can perfectly describe customer behaviour in telecommunication company

In the final stage of the competition, our team presented the analysis from the previous stages. I am pleased to say that our hard work paid off, as we were able to secure 2nd position in the data analysis category and 1st position for the best poster presentation. It was a great achievement and a testament to the dedication and effort put in by our team. We are proud of our accomplishments and grateful for the opportunity to participate in such a prestigious event.
