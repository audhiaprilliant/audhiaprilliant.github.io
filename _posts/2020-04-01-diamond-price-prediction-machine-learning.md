### Case Study
*Diamonds are priced according to the 4 C’s. Diamond carat weight and diamond color tend to have the most impact on the price. However, many factors contribute to the final price of any particular stone. Here are 7 factors of diamond prices, starting with the 4 C’s: carat weight, diamond color, diamond clarity, diamond cut, diamond shape, diamond grading, and market factors.*

### Personal Project
It's complex machine learning project that I have done. We really need to understand data, in the point of view as analyst and also common people. The objective is to find out function or algorithm that can predict the diamond price accurately. But one thing we have to remember, first we must explore the data properly. The data pre-processing must make sense, of course. This analysis covers aspects like:
- Data pre-processing
- Data visualization
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis
- Outliers detection
- Data modelling (linear regression and decision tree)
- Hyperparameter tuning
