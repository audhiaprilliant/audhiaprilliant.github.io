### Genetic Algorithm
The Genetic Algorithm is one of the metaheuristic algorithms. It has a similar mechanism as the natural evolution of Charles Darwin's theory (published in 1859). If you ask me what the metaheuristic algorithm is, we better talk about the differences with a heuristic.

So, what can the Genetic Algorithm do? Like other optimization algorithms, it will try to give us a set of solutions based on our objective function, constraints, and initial solution. As an illustration, it will give us robust cluster centroids in the k-means (will be discussed in another article in detail).
